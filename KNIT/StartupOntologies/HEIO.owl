Family Health Teams are groups of health care professionals, such as physicians, nurse practitioners, nurses, social workers and dieticians who work together to provide primary care for a group of patients. They provide a wide range of services including health promotion, treatment services, chronic disease management and prevention, rehabilitation and palliative care. They are available nights and weekends to provide health advice and care so their patients do not have to go to busy hospital emergency departments for non-emergency care. They also help their patients navigate their way through the other parts of the health care system to receive the best possible care (www.healthforceontario.ca). Family health teams are funded on a blended capitation basis similar to FHOs - the corporations may be governed by a community or provider board.

FHOs provide care during regular and extended office hours and patients have access to a nurse staffed Telephone Health Advisory Service.Funding is provided on a blended capitation model which is capitation based on a defined basket of primary care services provided to enrolled patients based on age/sex of each patient. Fee-for-service paid for other services. Additionally, physicians receive monthly comprehensive care capitation payments for all enrolled patients. Rostering and Patient Fees (i.e. New Patient Fee), and bonuses, premiums and special payments are paid for services such as chronic disease management, preventative care, pre-natal care and home visits for enrolled patients, and for hospital visits, obstetrical care and palliative care for all patients.
