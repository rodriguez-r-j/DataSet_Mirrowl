# MIRROWL: Repository of Original and Mirror Ontologies

MIRROWL is a repository dedicated to storing and managing original ontologies and their corresponding mirror ontologies (synthetic ontologies that attempt to replicate the originals).

This repository aims to help researchers in ontology evaluation tasks, especially when they have been created from segments of other ontologies. That is why everyone can collaborate and help develop Ontologies and mirrors.


## Repository Structure

The repository structure is represented as follows:

```
